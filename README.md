# Machine learning in Hurry

This is a fast paced tutorial on machine learning and computer vision covering following topics -

1. Review of some Math and comparison to programming

2. Curve fitting, Regression, Loss function, training

3. What is artifical neuron and neural network ?

    - Using ANN to predict house pricing
    - Relationship with Artifical Intelligence

4. Basics of image processing

    - What are filters ?
    - What is convolution (Cross correlation) ?

5. Overview of Computer Vision

    - Using a pre-trained model to classify images
    - Train a model to classify hand written digits
    - Face detection and recognition using a pre-trained model (dlib)

The notebook was created using Google Colaboratory (thank you Google for this awesome tool !!) and can be seen as a collection of (not so perfect) notes.

The images in the notebook are from various articles on web that helped my own understanding of these topics so all credit is to the original authors and creators of the images, drawings and figures.

If you are interested in editing and running the notebook you have few options -

1. [Preferred] Open it in colab by clicking on this link -->  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ksachdeva/ml-in-hurry/blob/master/Machine_Learning_In_Hurry.ipynb)

or,

2. Clone the repository and run on your computer. You would need to have following packages installed in your (virtual) python environment

    - keras
    - matplotlib
    - opencv-python
    - dlib
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - scikit-learn
    - jupyter
